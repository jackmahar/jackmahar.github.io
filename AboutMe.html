      <p class="info">My name is Jack Mahar. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, taking long walks, and just hanging out. I spend a lot of time at the computer reading, gaming, and creating things. Be it code or 3D designs or just messing around in Adobe Ilistrator. I started learning how to code and use 3D software in Eleventh grade at the Center for Technology Essex.</p>
      <p class="info"> CTE provided me with an amazing opportunity to expand my knowledge of art and computers via the Computer Animation and Web Design program (CAWD for short). Eleventh grade was rough due to COVID. We could only go into school twice a week, so I didn’t get to learn as much as I would have liked. However what I did learn that year, drove me into enrolling in the CAWD 2 program for senior year. This year I am getting to learn much more overall, but I am still thankful for what last year granted me.</p>
